# imageP-
imageP is an image editing software that i have built for my final project in Basics Of Image Processing Courses. The software has been built using Matlab and Matlab Guide Tools.

As the exe file is not ready yet, the software can be run having Matlab Installed and then run the command " imageP " in Matlab Terminal.

The source code will be avaible after presenting my project to my teacher. For preventing my classmate to copy the same.

Source Code May Be Avaible By This Friday.

imageP :)
